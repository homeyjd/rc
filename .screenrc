# Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
# A: The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate text buffer is selected.
#    The standard definitions of the termcap initialize capabilities ti and te switch to and from
#    the alternate text buffer. (The scrollbar also does not work when you start e.g. ‘vi’).
